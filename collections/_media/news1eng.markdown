KT announced on the 15th that it has expanded and reorganized the research scope of its AI (artificial intelligence)-based infectious disease response research application 'Shine' from flu to COVID-19.
The name of the app is an abbreviation for SHINE (Study of Health Information for Next Epidemic).
Shine is a mobile app for the purpose of collecting research data. It was developed for research on AI/big data-based infectious disease response technology that KT has been conducting with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation from 2020.
